KiloT - 'Build your own editor' fork of Kilo by Antirez
====================================

This is solely being used as a learning tool. If you notice anything 
in the comments that sounds wrong or can be worded better please let me know. 
The code is littered with a ridiculous amount of comments to help me with the
learning process.
