Ti - A Kilo fork
====================================

This is solely being used as a learning tool and isn't intended to be used in lieu of a well established
text editor.

Keeping true with the original Kilo project, the SLOC for this project aims to stay under 1024 lines.
Currently sitting at ~1152 lines according to sloc, but theres plenty of refactoring that can be done.

See original kilo source code at [github/antirez](https://github.com/antirez/kilo "Kilo Text Editor")

See [Paige Ruten's](https://github.com/paigeruten "paigeruten") 'BYOE' documents [here](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/02.enteringRawMode.html "Build Your Own Editor")

Any advice is greatly appreciated!

HOW TO INSTALL
==============

### Linux (will test other environments soon)

- Clone git repo
        
        git clone git@github.com:tairenfd/Ti.git
                           or                   
        git clone git@tairenfd.xyz:/var/www/git/

- cd into Ti/ directory
- while in the directory run the command

        sudo make install

- If you dont want to install using sudo you can also run 'make' and
either run it directly within the directory using './ti' or by
installing to another directory within your path manually. This
will just uninstalling slightly more tedious.
- Run with 

        ti \[options\] \[filename\]   


- Makefile flags: make help, make install, make uninstall, make dist, make options, 
make clean, make clean install

### Uninstall

- To uninstall Ti, if installed using the default Makefile, simply type use the below line

        sudo make uninstall

- This will uninstall the binary and remove the man pages
- Now just delete the Ti/ folder and it should be completely removed!

SETTINGS AND MORE
=================
- TI_TAB_STOP = Tab render size
- in editor-command: set theme <color> = Editor's "theme"
    - Black
    - Red
    - Green
    - Yellow
    - Blue
    - Magenta
    - Cyan
    - White / Default
        
- More info can be found in

        man ti
or

        ti -h

- 'ti -h' will show a help menu
- 'ti -v' will show current version of Ti
TODO
====

- Syntax highlighting:
    - Zsh
    - Make
    - Git
    - HTML
    - etc...
- Scroll buffer
- Refactoring of deletion functionalities
- Refactor binds
- Refactor suntax(?)
- Fix search function (same row functionality)
- Undo / Redo functionality
- Rewrite C -> Rust?

KNOWN ISSUES
============
- When saving an existing file as a new file, it results in memory error. Valgrind
states 'definitely lost block' equal to the amount of data input since new save. All 
data is successfully saved to new file, however nothing is written to original file 
after new file opened. Error is from previous file not being written to, resulting in 
'lost memory'.
- Search function only finds the first match in a row
